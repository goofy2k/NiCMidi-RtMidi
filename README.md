# NiCMidi RtMidi
 Keep NiCMidi clean. Adapt only low-level RtMidi class
 
 
 /*************************************************************************************************************************************
*
* A number of very basic examples from the NiCMidi lib (see main.cpp)
*
* DEMONSTRATORS FOR MIDI OUT
*
* The manager_main example below is probably the simplest example for testing newly implemented output drivers
* The test_component example has been shown to play single notes in another implementation of the nimBLE output driver
*
* Both examples (as implemented here) lead to a compilation error. See below.  What is missing?
*
* DEMONSTRATORS FOR MIDI IN
*
* The thru or metronome examples are probably the the most suited for this goal: 
*
*       **TO BE IMPLEMENTED ** 
*
